    <h1 id = "general"><b>General Questions</b></h1>
        <p><em><b>Is there a difference between climate change and global warming?</b></em></p>
            <p>Global warming refers to the overall, long-term warming of the planet over the last several decades. However
            climate change encompasses global warming and also refers to the other violently changing elements <pr>in nature esp.
            natural disaters (wildfires, hurricanes etc.), melting glaciers, and accelerating ice melts in the Arcitc and Antarctic.</p>
        <p><em><b>Is the sun causing global warming?</b></em></p>
            <p>The sun can't be causing global warming. A series of satellite reports that have been measuring the energy output <pr>
                of the sun since 1978 have seen a decrease in the output of energy from the sun. </p>
        <p><em><b>Can we still prevent climate change?</b></em></p>
            <p>Yes! We can still prevent climate change, but it will take agreement between all countries and governments. We will <pr>
                have to make policies that are radical and that the vast majority of countries can agree to. If we can't do this then <pr>
                some experts fear that in three years the damage that we have done will become irreversible. Climate scientists believe that <pr>
                if climate change can be brought permanently lower by the year 2020 then the runaway irreversible climate change will not be <pr>
                breached.</p>
        <p><em><b>Do scientists agree on climate change?</b></em></p>
                <p> Yes, the vast majority of scientists agree with climate change in fact, it is not the commonly said '97%'. In actuality, the <pr>
                number is much closer to 98.4% when you count authors of the papers instead of actual papers </p>
        <p><em><b>What is the greenhouse effect?</b></em></p>
                <p>The greenhouse effect happens when greenhouse gases gather in Earth's atmosphere and stay there for a prolonged <pr>
                 amount of time. The greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitruous oxide, water vapor (part of the precipitation cycle
                 so it is not harmful), and ozone. The greenhouse gases allow the sun's light to shine through onto Earth and past the 
                 atmosphere and keeps the heat from leaving. Much in the way that a real greenhouse works, letting heat in so the plants can
                 photosynthesize and trapping the heat so that the plants continue to grow.</p>  
        <p><em><b>What is the most harmful greenhouse gas?</b></em></p>
                <p> There is a lot of disagreement over what the most dangerous greenhouse gas is, but because of CO<sub>2</sub>'s ability to <pr>
                 stay in the atmosphere for a century, its concentration, and methane's ability to turn in CO<sub>2</sub> the cards are all in favor <pr>
                 of CO<sub>2</sub> for the most destructive greenhouse gas. Make no mistake, your ability to try and decrease your footprint of any of 
                 the gases is helpful to the environment. </p>
        <p><em><b>Why do some areas experience cooling instead of warming?</b></em></p>
                <p> Some areas experience cooling, because the overall effects of global warming can be contained in the phrase climate change<pr>
                 Climate change refers to all of the natural disasters that happen as a result of global warming. So, some areas may experience annual
                 cooling because of the occurence of snowstorms, rainstorms, hailstorms etc. And even though some areas experience cooling the overall <pr>
                 annual temperature value for the world continues to rise.</p>
        <p><em><b>Are humans causing global warming?</b></em></p>
                <p> Yes. Scientists have concluded that global warming is caused by the burning of coal, oil, gas, and by agricultrue. </p>
        <p><em><b>Don't volcanoes emit more carbon dioxide than humans?</b></em></p>
                 <p> By the largest estimate, volcanoes emit 645 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year while humans emit around 29 billion tons of<pr>
                 CO<sub>2</sub> per year. Comparatively volcanoes only emit a measly .02% of all carbon dioxide emmisions and I think we knoe what is <pr>
                 causing the vast majority of the remaining 99.98%. Human pollution.</p>               
        <p><em><b>Is global warming actually harmful?</b></em></p>
                  <p> Yes, global warming is actually harmful, because it catalyzes extreme weather changes and natural disasters. The <pr>
                  disastrous effects of global warming are rising sea levels (which will cause islands and entire states to become submerged <pr>
                  in water by the year 2100), ocean acidification (the ocean may no longer be able to sustain some life forms by the year 2100, and
                  humans would be advised to not go into the water), wildfires, hurricanes, and even more sporadic natural disasters. So yes, global
                  warming is, in fact, harmful to us moreso than it is to the planet.</p>
        <p><em><b>Are there benefits to global warming?</b></em></p>
                  <p> Yes, but in the grand scheme of things no. For most coutnries there is nothing to gain, but for China, they could see their <pr>
                      dry areas beginning to get rainfall and their flooding areas begin to get drier, but these effects would come with great consequences <pr>
                      for china and the rest of the world too. This favorable change in climate would be short-lived, because the overall negative effects of <pr>
                      climate change (violent disasters, melting ice caps, animal extinction) would continue to impact the globe.</p>
        <p><em><b>Can we reverse global warming?</b></em></p>
                  <p> For now, yes, but if we wait too long the effects of global warming will become permanent. In order for us to reverse out current climate <pr>
                      situation we need to actually meet our carbon goals, and began to level out and lower our output of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</p>
        <p><em><b>Hasn't Earth warmed and cooled naturally throughout history?</b></em></p>
                  <p> Monitoring climate conditions has showed us that the gradual rise in CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere correlates <pr>
                      with the man-made CO<sub>2</sub> emissions </p>
